#+TITLE: reMarkable2 tablet customizations and utilities

Repository showing how to build and deploy custom PNG templates for your reMarkable2 tablet.

** Prerequisites

I use Nix, if you don't use that then you will need to install the following on your own based on your own package management religion:

- inkscape
- bash
- scp/ssh

And an editor/IDE to create your own SVG files.

** Process

1. Create SVG template using appropriate dimensions for portrait and landscape:
   - Use your favorite editor or SVG creator for this step.
2. Convert SVG tempalte to PNG:
   - Run =./bin/pngize-templates= making sure to edit the template file list.
   - This ensures you have consistency between the PNG or SVG exports of your files.
3. Backup existing templates and =templates.json= configuration from device:
   - Run =./bin/backup-templates=.
4. Update =custom.json= to add new entries:
   - Use your favorite JSON editor to add or amend custom entries.
5. Copy new template files (SVGs and PNGs) with =templates.json= (updated with =custom.json= entries) to reMarkable2 paper tablet:
   - Run =./bin/sync-templates= which assumes you have setup SSH to your reMarkable2 device already (see SSH config section below).

** SSH config and sticky device IP on home network

I use my =reMarkable2= primarily on my home network, which I configured to issue my reMarkable2's MAC address the same persistent private IP address each time it connects. This allows me to fix the IP address for my reMarkable2 in my =~/.ssh/config= file for simpler
scripting.

This is an example of a remarkable2 entry:
#+begin_src ssh_config
Host remarkable2
  ForwardAgent no
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  Hostname 192.168.10.99
  User root
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
#+end_src

Then in my scripts above, I leverage the =remarkable2= alias for automation purposes.

The configuration necessary for your home network to issue the same fixed private IP to your device will be specific to your home
networing gear and as such I will not provide that information here.

** Templates

Some notes about the templates:
- portrait  ::  1404Ã—1872 pixels
- landscape :: 1872x1404 pixels
